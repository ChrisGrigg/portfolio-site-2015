  "data": "I have been employed as a front end developer for over 4.5 years, working in both HTML5/JavaScript & Flash. From May 2012 - Feb 2015 I was employed at an online games company working on their bingo, slots & other casino games. Previously I worked as a graduate Flex developer, and I have also been contracted several times to work as both an HTML5 & a Flash developer. In all these roles I have worked using Scrum and version control. I graduated from Brunel University, London in 2010 with a first class degree in Multimedia Technology & Design, coming top of my class which earned me the Cadline Prize. After completing my degree I showed my work in the 'Made In Brunel' exhibition and subsequently had my work published in the book '250 Innovative Ideas'. During my time at iBundle Ltd I took part in, and won, the Viadeo API London Hack Day competition with a team of 2 other colleagues. I am currently studying Japanese, and I am very passionate about animals and volunteer for The Blue Cross (a pet charity) as a fundraiser and dog walker. I take ballet classes, go rock climbing and I have run 2 marathons - Paris & Brighton. I also enjoy baking, reading and crafts."
